# gitimd - Get Teamed Up. 
Team-making engine.
Teams can join competitions or work without competing in contests

1. Create a teaming-up idea as a topic, a subject-matter interest: it could be a vague sense of an idea.
2. People interact with the idea while they become part of a proto-team.
3. We coalesce into a functioning team, where we agree on our work focus and then we begin working with focus. Some people remain in the background, so they become the entourage (an outer layer) and NOT the performing team.
4. Add a deadline (for a competition or a mutually agreed race against the clock.)
5. We may progress through these team state stages swiftly or slowly organically.
6. When people have a non-core role or aren't in the team: they go into the ecosystem surrounding the team. "It takes a village to raise a project."

Our inspiration was to solve many recurring process problems that arise when people start getting together to do things in common, in any context, in or beyond the hackathon field. We wanted to make a solution, abstract and antifragile, so that a proposed teaming idea, as a concept, can only be built forward not forgotten not destroyed, and therefore so that anyone can use gitimd app to get teamed up in any context.

Next steps: make it clearer how the idea-discussing proto-team group can decide, elect, choose, or vote to focus on a clear to-be-produced result. In their minds they become the real "team" because they have the same shared clarity. They view all the others as ecosystem "outer layer" and Gitimd gives them features to support that view. The outer layer acts as an entourage, surrounding, ambiance, environment.
